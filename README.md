# Luce

This repository contains the code for my master thesis. It contains examples on how to interact with the Ethereum blockchain via web3.py. It also contains a self-contained vagrant/virtualbox VM. Finally it contains my implementation of the Luce technical prototype, LUCI (Luce Implementation).
