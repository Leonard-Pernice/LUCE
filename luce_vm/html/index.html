    <h1> Welcome to LuceVM</h1>

    <p> Congratulations on setting up the LuceVM&trade;. LuceVM provides a convenient development environment for the LUCE technical implementation. It abstracts away the complexity of the underlying libraries. (The author, Arno, at some point found himself in dependency hell while trying to set up the solidity compiler and all other components on his Macbook. So he decided to start afresh, build a clean development environment on this Ubuntu 16.04 server and expose the desired functionality to the host machine via port forwarding.) I am very happy with the result and hope it will prove useful for other users as well. </p>
    
    <p> Next steps: <br>  
        Open up another browser window at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8888">127.0.0.1:8888</a> to access the Jupyter environment. <br>
        The login password is: luce <br> 
        There are various example notebooks. The most relevant part however is notebook x) which shows how to interact with the Luce smart contract from Python.</p>
